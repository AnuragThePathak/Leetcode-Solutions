# Leetcode Solutions

Here I've included solutions to the Leetcode problems I've solved so far and updating them as I go.

## How to use

- Problems are sorted topic-wise in separate folders.
- File name is the problem number followed by the problem name.
- Most of the code is in Java, a few are C++ too.
- The top of solution file has a comment which is the question (will try to include link as well in future).
- Rest is the solution.
